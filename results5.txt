Response: There's no single answer to how much money to bet on basketball games.  It entirely depends on your individual circumstances and risk tolerance.  Here's a breakdown of factors to consider:

* **Your Bankroll:** This is the most crucial factor.  Never bet more than you can afford to lose.  A common recommendation is to bet no more than 1-5% of your total bankroll on any single game.  For example, if you have a $100 bankroll, a 1% bet would be $1, while a 5% bet would be $5.  Sticking to a smaller percentage reduces the risk of significant losses.

* **Your Knowledge and Skill:**  Are you a seasoned basketball analyst with a deep understanding of the sport, teams, and players? Or are you a casual fan?  If you're new to betting, start with smaller bets to learn and refine your strategies.  Overconfidence can lead to significant losses.

* **The Odds:**  The odds offered by the bookmaker represent the implied probability of an outcome.  Higher odds suggest a lower probability but a higher potential payout.  Consider the odds carefully before placing a bet.

* **The Type of Bet:**  Different bet types carry different levels of risk.  Straight bets (moneyline, spread) are simpler than parlays or prop bets, which combine multiple outcomes. Parlays offer larger potential payouts but are riskier because all selections must win.

* **Your Betting Strategy:** Do you have a system or strategy?  Many successful bettors employ strategies like value betting (betting on odds that they believe are higher than the true probability) or following specific betting systems.  However, even with a strategy, losses are inevitable.

* **Entertainment Value:** Remember that sports betting should be entertainment.  Don't view it as a guaranteed way to make money.  If the stakes are too high, it can become stressful and detract from the enjoyment of the game.


**In short:**  Start small, manage your bankroll carefully, and only bet what you can afford to lose.  Focus on learning and developing your skills before increasing your bet sizes.  Responsible gambling is key.
